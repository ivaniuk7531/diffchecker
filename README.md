The project aims to develop a script for automatically monitoring and comparing files between the current CMS installation (particularly OJS â€“ Open Journal Systems) on the server and the original files from the official repository. This will help identify and restore files that have been altered or corrupted by malicious actors.

- **lint**: Runs ESLint on all `.ts` and `.tsx` files and attempts to fix issues.
