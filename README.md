The project aims to develop a script for automatically monitoring and comparing files between the current CMS installation (particularly OJS â€“ Open Journal Systems) on the server and the original files from the official repository. This will help identify and restore files that have been altered or corrupted by malicious actors.

### Available Scripts

The following npm scripts are available in this project:

- **start**: Builds the project and then starts the application.
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

- **dev**: Runs the application in development mode using `nodemon` for live reloading.
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```

- **build**: Cleans the previous build and compiles the project using TypeScript.
  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

- **lint**: Runs ESLint on all `.ts` and `.tsx` files and attempts to fix issues.
  ```bash
  yarn lint
  ```

- **prepare**: Initializes Husky for git hooks.
  ```bash
  yarn prepare
  ```

Make sure to install all dependencies before running these scripts:
